# Authly

Authly is a [You Ship We Ship](https://ysws.hackclub.com) program that rewards teenagers for creating unique and interesting authentication flows with a yubikey from yubico 

## 🎯 The Challenge

Create an original authentication flow that is not frontend only, it actually saves and uses accounts. 
This authentication flow should be unique and it can be as wacky as you want, as long as it is not a simple login form. 
If your submission is approved, you'll receive a yubikey to enhance your security!

## 📝 Submission Requirements

1. **Self-Written**: Your program must be self-written and should not use any plug & play framework such as Firebase, Supabase, Clerk etc
2. **Unique Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow should be unique and not a simple login form. It can be as creative as you want, but it should not be frontend only.
It **cannot** be a simple login form, it should be something that is not commonly seen in other authentication flows.
3. **Originality**: It must not be a remake of an existing authentication flow or someone else's.
4. **Open Source**: Your code must be open source and available on GitHub.
5. **Documentation**: Your code must be well documented and easy to understand. You should also be able to explain your code and the authentication flow in detail.
6. **Fully Functional**: Your app must work for multiple users - not just a demo for one person. No frontend-only stuff. Real users, real accounts. It’s okay to use simple session/cookie tools (like Flask or Express sessions).
7. **Coding Time Tracking**:  You must track all your coding time using Hackatime. A minimum of 6-10 hours of logged development time is required for your submission to be eligible.
